Xcode Theme: Perdition
======================

This is my personal theme for editor colors & fonts in Xcode 8.

It's based on the default Xcode theme, with color cues from the Atom [One Light](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax) theme.

# Prerequisites

To get it to look exactly the same, you'll need to download and install my [custom build](https://github.com/leonbreedt/iosevka-term-custom) of the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font.
